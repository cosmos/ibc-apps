# IBC Modules

IBC Modules are self-contained applications that enable packets to be sent to and received from other IBC-enabled chains.  IBC application developers do not need to concern themselves with the low-level details of clients, connections, and proof verification.

The current IBC modules in this repository are:

- [Interchain Queries](./async-icq/README.md)
- [IBC Hooks](./ibc-hooks/README.md)
